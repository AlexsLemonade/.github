# About Us 

[The Childhood Cancer Data Lab](https://www.ccdatalab.org/) was established by Alex’s Lemonade Stand Foundation (ALSF) in 2017. 
The Data Lab is a team of data scientists, designers, engineers, and communicators. 
Our mission is to accelerate the pace of finding novel cures and treatments for childhood cancer by putting resources and knowledge in the hands of pediatric cancer experts. 

We construct tools that make vast amounts of data widely available, easily mineable, and broadly reusable. 
We also train researchers to better understand their own data and to advance their work more quickly. 
The Data Lab team simultaneously contributes to childhood cancer research and to the open science and open source software communities.

# Our Projects

## refine.bio 

[`refine.bio`](https://www.refine.bio/) is a multi-organism collection of genome-wide transcriptome or gene expression data that has been obtained from publicly available repositories and uniformly processed and normalized.
 
* [Read the documentation.](http://docs.refine.bio/en/latest/)
* [Get started](https://alexslemonade.github.io/refinebio-examples/01-getting-started/getting-started.html) with [example workflows for use with refine.bio data.](https://github.com/AlexsLemonade/refinebio-examples)
* [Learn about building and running the refine.bio project source code.](https://github.com/AlexsLemonade/refinebio)

## Single-cell Pediatric Cancer Atlas (ScPCA)

ALSF created the [`Single-cell Pediatric Cancer Atlas (ScPCA)`](https://scpca.alexslemonade.org/) project to generate an unprecedented resource for the pediatric cancer research community. 
Through funding investigators’ single-cell profiling of patient samples, ALSF established an atlas of over 500 samples from more than 50 cancer types and growing. 
To maximize the reach of this resource, the Data Lab built the ScPCA Portal to make the uniformly processed data freely available.


* [Explore and immediately download data from the ScPCA Portal.](https://scpca.alexslemonade.org/) 
* [Processing workflows for ScPCA data.](https://github.com/AlexsLemonade/scpca-nf)
* [ScPCA tools](https://github.com/AlexsLemonade/scpcaTools) and [data files for testing them.](https://github.com/AlexsLemonade/scpcaData)
* [User information about ScPCA processing.](https://github.com/AlexsLemonade/scpca-docs)


**Interested in submitting your data to the Portal?**
We can accept submissions of 10x Genomics single-cell or single-nuclei profiling of childhood and adolescent cancer (ages 0-19) data, broadly defined to include relevant animal models, patient-derived xenografts, or cell lines, as well as tumor data. 

* [View the full contribution guidelines](https://scpca.alexslemonade.org/contribute) to learn more.
* [Submit an interest form](https://share.hsforms.com/1Fs_Z94OzS7abnh5qEieOTA336z0) to be notified about our next call for contributions!

Email [`scpca@ccdatalab.org`](mailto:scpca@ccdatalab.org) with any questions about the Portal or submitting data.

## Open Pediatric Brain Tumor Atlas (OpenPBTA)

The [`Open Pediatric Brain Tumor Atlas (OpenPBTA)`](https://www.ccdatalab.org/openpbta) project was a global open science initiative, which analyzed a vast collection of pediatric brain tumor data, comprising data from over 1,000 tumors. 
This project operated on an open contribution model, crowdsourcing expertise from childhood brain cancer experts from across the world. 

In May 2023, this work was published in *Cell Genomics*. 
[Read the OpenPBTA paper](https://www.cell.com/cell-genomics/fulltext/S2666-979X(23)00115-5) to learn more!

* [View the repository for the collaboratively written manuscript.](https://github.com/AlexsLemonade/OpenPBTA-manuscript) (now archived)

# Training Workshops

We offer [`training workshops`](http://ccdatalab.org/training) to teach researchers the data science skills they need to examine their own data.
Participants are introduced to the R programming language, reproducible research practices, and to cutting-edge technologies used in single-cell and bulk RNA-sequencing data analysis. 

* [View our current training modules.](https://github.com/AlexsLemonade/training-modules) 
* [Sign up to be notified about future training workshops.](https://share.hsforms.com/1y55bYTSKSVKVOejXnM9lIg336z0) 

All Data Lab training materials are openly licensed and freely available for others to use. 
**Interested in using our materials to hold your own workshop?** 
[Learn how to get started](https://www.ccdatalab.org/hold-a-workshop) and [fill out the instructor interest form](https://share.hsforms.com/1KgR746BzThGUs-NG4oHgsw336z0) to submit an inquiry.

Email [`training@ccdatalab.org`](mailto:training@ccdatalab.org) with any questions about attending or holding a workshop.
